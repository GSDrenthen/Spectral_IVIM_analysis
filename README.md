# Spectral_IVIM_analysis

Code used to perform the spectral analysis of IVIM data in Matlab.

* Non negative least squares approach is used to extract three diffusion components (by Wong et al.: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.26920).
* The singular value decomposition filter is used to reduce noise in the data (by Bydder and Du: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2006.03.006).
* ExploreDTI is used for preprocessing the IVIM data (https://www.exploredti.com/)
